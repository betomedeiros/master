<p>It first, I tought: ""well, ISO/OGC gave me a finished UML, so I will have each class in C# and in Python to have the same signature"".</p>

<p>I quickly found myself stuck in the ""strict/static vs duck typing"" problem, since I cannot count on method signatures in python. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overloading constructors is quite common and natural in C#, but in Python you have to resort to <code>*args **kwargs</code> and conditionals;</li>
<li>Properties are encouraged in C#, but most source code I have seen around in Python tend to set the fields directly, although the use of <code>@property</code> or <code>property()</code> is quite straightforward.</li>
<li>(and so on).</li>
</ul>

<p>Actually there is (obviously) an obvious and very well documented ""difference in mindsets"" between one language and the other, and I would like to respect those differences while at the same time ending up with ""the same"" application, that is, equivalent domain model, architecture and functionality.</p>

<p>So my question basically is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I am to implement the same abstract model (""UML-like"") in Python and C#, how should I proceed, and specifically, which constructs should be invariant, and which should be different?</p>

E.g. Embarcadero Delphi has Open Tools API, that allows developers to create (and integrate into Delphi IDE) modules that programmatically creates forms, places components on them, writes code inside files and so on. These are great features because they let developers to integrate those frameworks (VCL, ADF and so on) into Model Driven Development (MDD) workflows (be it commercially provided or custom made by team of developers).</p>

<p>The question is - have JDeveloper such features - to create modules programmatically. E.g. one can imagine the workflow where UML class diagram is created by some third party tool. Is it possible to write some MDD transformation module (as JDeveloper plugin) that programmtically generates required ADF business components and web forms?</p>

<p>Certainly business components and forms can be created manually but does Oracle ADF or JDeveloper expose some API that could let create those components and forms programmtically without interaction with users. All the input data can be provided as XML file (that is output from UML designer or some other tool).</p>

<p>As far as I know there is JDeveloper Extensions but in Oracle forums I have received answers that JDeveloper Extensions are not intended for such a use.</p>

<p>I guess that ADF Essentials is becoming quite popular and there should be some interest to integrate ADF Essentials into MDD workflows. Maybe there are some hidden JDeveloper Extensions features or maybe even separate open source projects that already enable such integration.</p>

<p>Certainly, ADF business components and forms are usual code (XML, Java) files and the process to generate them can be reverse-engineered. Maybe there are some ongoing efforts to do that? I could contribute to them and not to start new project from scratch.</p>

<p>JDeveloper itself has some MDD features but I am not sure if these are rich and flexible enough.</p>

<p>I created a toy model as answered yesterday as awynne suggested, and I'm very close.  I'm only using EMF and its generated tree editor.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of my EMF meta-model:</p>

<pre><code>- EClass: Widget
  - name

- EClass: WidgetReference
  - aWidgetReference : Widget [0..1] Containment = false

- EClass: WidgetContainer
  - myWidgets : Widget [0..*] Containment = true

- EClass: ReferenceContainer
  - myReferences : WidgetReference [0..*] Containment = true

- EClass: TopLevelClass
  - myWidgetContainer    : [1] WidgetContainer    Containment = true
  - myReferenceContainer : [1] ReferenceContainer Containment = true
</code></pre>

<p>What's happening now is that in the generated tree editor for the model, I create everything starting from the TopLevelClass.  I can successfully create multiple widgets in the WidgetContainer, and I can create a single WidgetReference in the ReferenceContainer and associate it with a specific Widget.  </p>

<p>In case anyone runs into this, there is a bug in the generated EMF editor code:</p>

<p>When I try to add more than one WidgetReference to the ReferenceContainer, the tree editor only shows the first WidgetReference under the ReferenceContainer.  If I click on the WidgetReferences item in the tree, it does show multiple WidgetReferences in the properties view.  It just won't let me see them in the tree, and therefore won't let me select them to change their reference to associate it to an actual widget.  </p>

<p>The workaround to this is to create as many references as you need, save and close the model, and then re-open it.  Upon re-opening it, all of the references will be shown.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help/guidance.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a <strong>good pattern/standard way</strong> to generate PHP code from some sort of abstraction layer.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>I've built a set of classes that act es text-processing filters. These filters can be chained together to transform some input-text into some other output text, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Input ""Hello 'CRUEL' World"" 
&gt;&gt; RegexFilter('(.*?)') [extract everything between '']
&gt;&gt; ToLowerFilter [lowercase the extracted text]
Output: cruel
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Resulting Code</strong></p>

<p>The corresponding source code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$input = ""Hello 'CRUEL' world"";
$pattern = ""#(.*?)#"";
$first = new RegexFilter($pattern);
$second = new ToLowerFilter();
$first-&gt;setNextFilter($second);
$ouput = $first-&gt;Transform($input);
echo $output; // cruel
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to create some sort of <em>abstraction layer</em>, so that the end user (non-programmer) can built his own filter chain without writing code by himself. By ""abstraction"" I mean something like XML, JSON, stored in a database, etc.</p>

<p><strong>XML example (suggestion)</strong> </p>

<pre><code>&lt;filters&gt;
 &lt;filter name='Regex'&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
   &lt;property name='pattern'&gt;'(.*)'&lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
  &lt;nextfilter name='ToLower'&gt;
   &lt;properties/&gt;
  &lt;/filter&gt;
 &lt;/filter&gt;
&lt;/filters&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Remark</strong>: The example is very simplistic. Think of more advanced things like ""complex objects as properties for filters"", ""inheritance of filters"" (the above filter could get the name ""RegexToLowerFilter"" and can be referenced by other filters), etc.</p>

<p><strong>Approaches / Ideas</strong></p>

<p>Is there standard way to tackle this sort of problem? So far I've thought of building a custom XML, JSON, etc. serializer/deserializer for every filter but that seems like a lot of work and is potentially error prone because it's done individually for every filter. Further I guess that would require to make <em>every possible dependency</em> also serilizable in the same fashion - which can be problematic when using third party libraries (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/Peekmo/JsonPath/"" rel=""nofollow"">JsonPath</a>).</p>

<p>I suppose the most elegant way would be the creation of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">Domain Specific Language</a>. Unfortunately building a compiler is not the easiest task and probably not always appropriate for every problem in that space. (Then again, feel free to correct me :))</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for a suitable way / pattern to built an abstraction layer between the (non-progammer) end user and my source code. The solution should take the ""simplified"" abstraction and ""generate"" the corresponding code.</p>

<p>In my opinion, code generation is a valuable tool in my toolbox and I make heavy use of templates and automation when needed. I also create diagrams in UML when I think this helps to understand the inner working or to discuss architecture on the white board. However, I strongly doubt that creating software via UML (creating statecharts and sequence diagrams to create working code not only skeletons of code) is more efficient for multi tier applications (database layer, business/domain layer and a Gui, maybe even distributed). It seems to me when it comes to MDSD, the CASE tooling suddenly isn't just a tool anymore but it is the thing to satisfy: As I see it, on the one hand, MDSDevelopers profit from the higher abstraction UML gives them but at the same time they are struggling with modifing the codegenerator/template/engine to fullfill their needs which might be easily implemented (and tested) if used another tool out of their toolbox (VisualStudio, Eclipse,...).</p>

<p>All this makes me wonder if there has been a success story (suceess being that the product was rolled out in time, within the budged and with only few bugs and parts of the software have been reused later on) for a real world application which fullfills this creteria and has been developed using a strict model driven approach: </p>

<ul>
<li>it has nothing to do with the the Object Management Group (OMG) or with consultants related to MDSD/MDA/SOA/</li>
<li>the application is not related to Business Process Modelling and is not a CASE tool itself</li>
<li>the application is actively used by end user</li>
<li>it has at least three tiers, including a user interface which goes beyond displaying raw table values and is not one of the common MDA/MDSD examples (""how to model a coffee machine, traffic light, dishwasher"").</li>
</ul>

Our current codebase is not structured very well and we are looking both at how to improve it immediately (by organizing objects into namespaces, separating concerns, etc.) and moving to a model driven architecture approach, where we model and design everything first with uml, then generate code from that model.  We have been looking heavily at Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect (EA) (which is UML 2.0 capable) and we are also considering the tools in VS 2010.  I know there are other tools out there (Rational XDE being one) but I really do not think we can spend $1500+ per license at this point.  </p>

<p>I'm not looking for answers on which tool is better than another but more for experiences moving from a cowboy coding environment (that is, little planning and design, just jump in and start coding) to a model driven architecture. Looking back was it helpful to your organization?  What are the pain points?  What are the risks?  What are the benefits?</p>

If so, what tools do you use, and how is it working out?","<p>Model Driven Architecture is the idea that you create models which express the problem you need to solve in a way that is free of any (or at least most) implementation technologies, and then you generate implementation for one or more specific platforms. The claim is that working at a higher level of abstraction is far more powerful and productive. In addition, your models outlive technologies (so you still have something when your first language / platform becomes obsolete that you can use for your next generation solution). Another key claimed benefit is that much of the boilerplate and ""grunt work"" can be generated. Once the computer understands the semantics of your situation, it can help you more.</p>

<p><em>Some claim this approach is 10 times more productive, and that it is <strong>the way</strong> we will all be building software in 10 years.</em></p>

<p>However, this is all just theory. I am wondering what the outcomes are when the rubber meets the road. Also, the ""official"" version of MDA is from the <a href=""http://omg.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OMG</a>, and seems very heavy. It is heavily based on UML, which might be considered good or bad depending on who you ask (I'm leaning towards ""bad"").</p>

<p>But, in spite of those concerns, it is hard to argue with the idea of working at a higher level of abstraction and ""teaching"" the computer to understand the semantics of your problem and solution. Imagine a series of ER models which simply express truth, and then imagine using those to generate a significant portion of your solution, first in one set of technologies and then again in another set of technologies.</p>

<p>So, <strong>I'd love to hear from people who really are doing MDA right now (""official"" or not). What tools are you using? How is it working out? How much of the theoretical promise have you been able to capture? Do you see a true 10X effectiveness increase?</strong></p>

The model can be either valid, invalid or partially invalid, i.e. it contains errors but some parts of it are valid and can be processed further.</p>

<p>The most simple error reporting is to use exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>public class Transformer {
    public TargetModel transform(SourceModel model)
      throws InvalidModelException {
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this doesn't allow to report multiple errors (at least if you don't attach further information to the exception) and exceptions should be for exceptional situations.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler addressed this problem in his article <em><a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/replaceThrowWithNotification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Replacing Throwing Exceptions with Notification in Validations</a></em>. If you apply his method to the problem you have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Problem {
    // ...
}

public final class ProblemA {
    // ...
}

public final class ProblemB {
    // ...
}

public class Transformer {
    public static final class TransformationResult {
        private Collection&lt;Problem&gt; problems;
        private Optional&lt;TargetModel&gt; targetModel;
        // ...
    }

    public TransformationResult transform(SourceModel model) {
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You then either use the visitor pattern or <code>instanceof</code> checks to distinguish the errors. It's a trade-off between type-safety and verbosity.</p>

<p>Another possible solution would be to use the observer pattern:</p>

<pre><code>public class Transformer {
    public interface ProblemListener {
        public void onProblemA(...);
        public void onProblemB(...);
        // ...
    }

    public void addProblemListener(ProblemListener listener) {
        // ...
    }

    public void removeProblemListener(ProblemListener listener) {
        // ...
    }

    public TargetModel transform(SourceModel model) {
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using the observer pattern has the advantage that you don't have to accumulate the errors in memory and that excessive <code>instanceof</code> checks or visitors are not needed. On the other hand it obscures the control flow even more than the visitor pattern.</p>

<p>I think all solutions do not lead to readable code. In a functional language and with enough memory I would use the second solution but in Java structural pattern matching either entails <code>instanceof</code> checks or use of visitor pattern which are both verbose. Is there anything that I have overlooked? Or implications that I did not consider? What is your experience with any of the solutions?</p>

Sure it is wise to clarify your modeling vocabulary: some may say <em>class</em> where others say <em>entity</em> or <em>concept</em>, but this is just simple documentation your modeling terminology. Meta-modeling, as I understand it, is more complex, as it tries to formalize and abstract modeling. Some good examples are  Keet's <a href=""http://www.meteck.org/pubcmk.html#EMMSAD08"">formal comparison of conceptual data modeling languages</a> (UML, ERM and ORM) from academia and the Meta Object Facility (MOF) from industry.

<p>My question is, how feasible is it to generate code files for other (multiple) languages instead of just Java.
